                Musilitar is a system that learns by itself to provide a more automatic and rigid customer support. <br>
                You can ask it questions directly or add your Twitter account below to let it find questions automatically. <br>
                When it doesn't know an answer to your question it'll search Wikipedia to find one. <br>
                Your feedback on its responses is invaluable, as this is the best way to make it form more correct answers. <br>
                Musilitar was born as a simple minded child and is working its way to becoming a wise old sage.
